Jeff Sheffields Emacs Config
================

Contains my emacs .config, as well as an installation script for installing the various plugins I use.
## To Bootstrap your emacs 
- $ mkdir -p $HOME/emacs/plugins
- $ cd $HOME/emacs
- clone this repo
- $ cd jds_emacs_config
- $ ./install.sh

Congradulations: you should now have git configured for several handy plugins.
